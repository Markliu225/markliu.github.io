As a senior undergraduate student working at the intersection of *Networked System* and *AI for Network*, I focus on developing sustainable and resilient networking solutions for next-generation infrastructures. Currently, I'm advancing my research in fault-tolerant traffic engineering for large-scale networks under the supervision of Prof. Shizhen Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I investigate robust network optimization strategies that balance transmission efficiency with system reliability. Concurrently, I continue my long-term research under the supervision of Prof. Huaxi Gu and Prof. Wenting Wei at Xidian University's ANTL since December 2022, conducting  research on traffic matrix completion in satellite networks.

Looking forward, I will join Prof. Yonggang Wen's research group at Nanyang Technological University in August 2025 to pursue green computing solutions for data center networks, aiming to develop energy-aware networking paradigms that align with global sustainability goals. My ongoing work bridges intelligent network control mechanisms with environmental considerations, seeking to establish theoretical foundations for eco-efficient network operations in AI-driven computing infrastructures.
