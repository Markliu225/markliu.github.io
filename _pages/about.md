As a researcher working at the intersection of Network for AI and AI for Network systems, I focus on developing sustainable and resilient networking solutions for next-generation infrastructures. Currently, I'm advancing my research in fault-tolerant traffic engineering for large-scale networks under Prof. Shizhen Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I investigate robust network optimization strategies that balance transmission efficiency with system reliability. Concurrently, I continue my long-term collaboration with Prof. Huaxi Gu and Prof. Wenting Wei at Xidian University's ANTLab since December 2022, conducting fundamental research on traffic matrix completion in satellite networks and reconfigurable optical network architectures.

Looking forward, I will join Prof. Yonggang Wen's research group at Nanyang Technological University in August 2025 to pursue green computing solutions for data center networks, aiming to develop energy-aware networking paradigms that align with global sustainability goals. My ongoing work bridges intelligent network control mechanisms with environmental considerations, seeking to establish theoretical foundations for eco-efficient network operations in AI-driven computing infrastructures.
